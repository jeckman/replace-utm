##Fuck UTM
A chrome extension that automatically replaces UTM campaign parameters with "YO+MAMA".  View more information and download [here](http://smithamilli.com/fuck-utm/).

##Caveats
- The extension checks the "href" attribute of all <a> tags, so it won't work if a url in a link is shortened.
- Because the extension redirects you to links via Javascript in very rare instances if a site uses event handlers in an obfuscated way there is a possibility of something not working.  An example of this has not yet been seen though.
